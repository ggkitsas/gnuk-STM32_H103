Using Gnuk Token with another computer
======================================

This document describes how you can use Gnuk Token
on another PC (which is not the one you generate your keys).

Note that the Token only brings your secret keys,
while ``.gnupg`` directory contains keyrings and trustdb, too.


Fetch the public key and connect it to the Token
================================================

Using the Token, we need to put the public key and the secret
key reference (to the token) in ``.gnupg``.

To do that, invoke GnuPG with ``--card-edit`` option. ::

  $ gpg --card-edit

  General key info..: [none]
  
  gpg/card> 

It says, there is no key info related to this token on your PC (``[none]``).

Fetch the public key from URL specified in the Token. ::

  gpg/card> fetch
  gpg: requesting key 4CA7BABE from http server www.gniibe.org
  gpg: key 4CA7BABE: public key "NIIBE Yutaka <gniibe@fsij.org>" imported
  gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
  gpg: Total number processed: 1
  gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)
  
  gpg/card> 

Good.  The public key is now in ``.gnupg``.  We can examine by ``gpg --list-keys``.

However, the secret key reference (to the token) is not in ``.gnupg`` yet.

It will be generated when I do ``--card-status`` by GnuPG with
correspoinding public key in ``.gnupg``, or just type return
at the ``gpg/card>`` prompt. ::

OK, now I can use the Token on this computer.


Update trustdb for the key on Gnuk Token
========================================

Yes, I can use the Token by the public key and the secret
key reference to the card.  More, I need to update the trustdb.

To do that I do: ::

  $ gpg --edit-key 4ca7babe

See, the key is ``unknown`` state.  Add trust for that. ::

  gpg> trust

  Please decide how far you trust this user to correctly verify other users' keys
  (by looking at passports, checking fingerprints from different sources, etc.)

    1 = I don't know or won't say
    2 = I do NOT trust
    3 = I trust marginally
    4 = I trust fully
    5 = I trust ultimately
    m = back to the main menu
  
  Your decision? 5
  Do you really want to set this key to ultimate trust? (y/N) y

  Please note that the shown key validity is not necessarily correct
  unless you restart the program.

Next time I invoke GnuPG, it will be ``ultimate`` key.  Let's see: ::
